## What is a List?

A collection or grouping of items! (String, floats, boolean values, other lists, dictionaries).
One strucutre, a data structure. A data structure is a higher level up of a data type that'll store other data types inside it.
(Other languages would call a "list" an "array")

```
item1 = "bananas"
item2 = "lego set"
```

^ This would only work if you kept adding the different variables and defining what each one means.

A list allows us to have as many pieces of data we want in a structure. A little database stored inside a Python variable. We could reorder the items, add, delete, etc.

## How are Lists Useful?

A fundamental data strucutre for organizing collections of items.

```
first_task = "install Python"
second_task = "Learn Python"
third_task = "take a break"
```

With these variables, they are unordered and separated. We want them to be associated.

## What Lists Look Like

- The key syntax that we'll see all the time are the square brackets.
- Comma separated values.
- Values do not need to be the same type. You could have a number, boolean, a string, etc.

```
tasks = ["Install Python", "Learn Python", "Take a break"]
OR
tasks = [first_task, second_task, third_task]
```

We could use a variable that references a string and add it in.
