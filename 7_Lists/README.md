## What is a List?

A collection or grouping of items! (String, floats, boolean values, other lists, dictionaries).
One strucutre, a data structure. A data structure is a higher level up of a data type that'll store other data types inside it.
(Other languages would call a "list" an "array")

```
item1 = "bananas"
item2 = "lego set"
```

^ This would only work if you kept adding the different variables and defining what each one means.

A list allows us to have as many pieces of data we want in a structure. A little database stored inside a Python variable. We could reorder the items, add, delete, etc.
