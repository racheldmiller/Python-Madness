# Variables can be:
# - Assigned to other variables.
# - Reassigned at any time.
# - Assigned at the same time as other variables.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# In Python, you can name variables whatever you like, but with some restrictions:
# 1. Must start with a letter or underscore.
# 2. Rest of the name must consist of letters, numbers, or underscores.
# 3. Names are case-sensitive.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Most variables are snake_case. camelCase is ok, but hello, Python? Snake?
dog_name = "Lucky"  # Example
# CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE refers to a constant. So it won't change.
THIS_IS_PI = 3.14
# Upper CamelCase usually refers to a class.
# Variables that start and end with two underscores is called "dunder"
# Dunder = double underscore
# Supposed to be private or left alone.
# Common for open source code. Don't tamper with it; it could mess up the application.
