# Numbers

Python can be used as a calculator, but that's not the only magic it has.

| Integer | Floating Point |
| ------- | -------------- |
| 4       | 6.1            |
| 57      | 1.333          |
| -10     | 0.0            |

```
type(9)
<class 'int'>
type(9.0)
<class'float'>
```

# Math

| Symbol | Name             |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| `+`    | Addition         |
| `-`    | Subtraction      |
| `*`    | Multiplication   |
| `/`    | Division         |
| `**`   | Exponentation    |
| `%`    | Modulo           |
| `//`   | Integer Division |

- In Python, divison always returns a float.
- Modulo:
  - is kind of like division, but it's the remainder operator.
  - Divides a number as many times as it can, and then gives us the remainder.
  - `10 % 3 = 1` (because 3x3 = 9; 10-9 = 1)
  - `25 % 4 = 1` (because 6x4 = 24; 25-24 = 1)
  - Used commonly to figure out if a number is even or odd.
- Integer Division:
  - Results as in integer in Python.
  - Because it chops off the ending, no float.
  - Doesn't round to the nearest whole number; rounds down.
  - `10//3 = 3`

# Variables

- Are like containers; it stores data.
- Holds all sorts of things, like numbers, booleans, and strings.
- Like math, it's a symbol that holds a value.
- I'll attach more notes about variables in Python.
