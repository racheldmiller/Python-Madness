# Iterating Dictionaries 
```
student = {
"name": "Rachel",
"owns_dog": False,
"favorite_language": "Python",
"is_hilarious": True,
27: "my favorite number"
}
```
Iterating over a list is more straightforward because a list on its own is already iterable.
Examples: `for num in numbers`, `for color in colors`

With a dictionary, if we wanted to print every single piece of information out, every value, we'd have to do:
```
print(student["name"])
print(student["owns_dog"])
```
There's a few different methods to access all values in a dictionary. We can:
- Loop through `keys`
- Loop through `values`
- Loop through both at the same time. 

## Looping Through Keys
use `.keys()`
`student.keys()` returns things like "name", "owns_dog", "favorite_language", "is_hilarious".

## Looping Through Values
use `.values()`
```
for value in student.values():
    print(value)
```
returns things like "Rachel", "False", "Python", "True", "my favorite number"

## Looping Through BOTH
use `.items()`
Write two variables.
```
for key, value in student.items():
    print (key, value)
    
for k, v in student.items():
    print(f" key is {k} and value is {v}")
```
returns things like `key is name and value is Rachel`. 
        
There are some other methods that make things even simpler!

## Clear
Clears all the keys and values in a dictionary. 
Leaves you with a hollow shell of what was there before. 
```
d = dict (a=1, b=2, c=3)
d.clear()
d # {}
```

## Copy
Makes a copy of the dictionary.
```
d = dict (a=1, b=2, c=3)
d.copy()
c = d.copy()
c # {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c': 3}
c is d # False 
```
Just like when copying lists, they look the same and double equals. If we use "is", they are unique objects in memory. They're not stored in the same place.

== is the test for equality.
"is" is the test for equality... in memory. They're not referencing the exact same place in memory.

## fromkeys
creates key-value pairs from comma separated values.
Call it on an empty dictionary orr on dict. 
If we have a bunch of keys that we're trying to set up to a default value. 

## Get
Retries a key in an object and returns None instead of a KeyError if the key does not exist.
