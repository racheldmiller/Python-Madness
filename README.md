## Context

JavaScript is the first language I started learning in Mar. 2019. I fell off the grid from coding (the one thing you SHOULDN'T do, I know), and now I have to basically start from scratch again. Well, JavaScript was a wild experience. I decided to switch it up and learn Python. Even though Python is a back-end language, maybe I might like it more? Maybe I'll find it easier, as I can apply some familiar knowledge to it? We'll see. I am currently following Colt Steele's The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp on Udemy.

## Why Learn Python 3 over Python 2.xx?

- Easier to learn Python 3.xx and then learn the quirks of Python 2.xx.
- Main criticisms of Python 3.xx don't apply anymore because that was ~10 yrs. ago.
- Almost all popular packages support 3.xx now.
- Python 2.7 will retire sometime in 2020.
