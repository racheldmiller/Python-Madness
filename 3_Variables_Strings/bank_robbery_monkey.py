# I just robbed a bank with some of my friends. We got away with $19,867,324,678,97.99 and now we have to split it up 5 ways.
# Using the `cash` variable defined, print out the dollar amount each robber gets to keep. (divide `cash` by 5 and print the answer out)

cash = 19867324678987.99

# So use division.
print(cash/5) = 3973464935797.5977
